The problem is to compute an approximate probability that in a group of n people at least two have the same birthday. For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as leap years, twins, seasonal, or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely.
(Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis.[nb 1] Actually, a uniform distribution of birth dates is the worst case.[5])
The goal is to compute P(A), the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate P(A′), the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because A and A′ are the only two possibilities and are also mutually exclusive, P(A) = 1 − P(A′).
In deference to widely published solutions[which?] concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a P(A) that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of P(A) will use 23 people as an example. If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the event that all 23 people have different birthdays 
is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22. Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on. 
One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using conditional probability: the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1. Similarly, the probability of Event 
3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2.
